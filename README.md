LaunchPad_Kit
=============

Grove starter kit for TI LaunchPad(MSP430/CC3200 etc).

###About this kit

This is a Grove library for TI LaunchPad. The example sketch works with [Energia](https://github.com/energia/Energia/wiki).
The LaunchPad is a set of Evaluation Kits from Texas Instruments. To introduce new functionality to the LaunchPad evaluation kits, we present the BoosterPack which is a plug-in board that fit on top of the LaunchPad baseboards. It offers a convenient and easy way for you to use more than one hundred Grove modules with standardized connectors, including sensors, actuators, displays, lights, motors and so on.
To use Energia you will need to read the [getting started](https://github.com/energia/Energia/wiki) guide.
